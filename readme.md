# COP 1334 Assignment - Introduction to C++

## Chapter 4: Challenge 3

## Title: Magic Dates

### Exercise Description:

The date June 10, 1960 is special because when we write it in the following format, the month times the day equals the year.

6/10/60

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message saying the
date is not magic.

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

We must provide to the Compiler the same switches that we usually do in the IDE:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name
Type the year: 2024
Type the month (1-12): 2
Type the day (1-29): 12
The date is magic.

Process finished with exit code 0
reinier@reinier % 
```
